# sht3x-spin
------------

This is a P8X32A/Propeller, P2X8C4M64P/Propeller 2 driver object for the Sensirion SHT3x (30, 31, 35) combination temperature and relative humidity sensors.

**IMPORTANT**: This software is meant to be used with the [spin-standard-library](https://github.com/avsa242/spin-standard-library) (P8X32A) or [p2-spin-standard-library](https://github.com/avsa242/p2-spin-standard-library) (P2X8C4M64P). Please install the applicable library first before attempting to use this code, otherwise you will be missing several files required to build the project.

## Salient Features

* I2C connection at ~30kHz (P1: SPIN I2C), up to 1MHz (P1: PASM I2C, P2)
* Measurement in one-shot (with clock-stretching) or continuous modes
* Supports all three measurement repeatability modes and five data rates
* On-chip heating element operation
* Reading the sensor's serial number
* Supports alternate slave address
* Set interrupt thresholds
* Optional reset pin

## Requirements

P1/SPIN1:
* spin-standard-library
* 1 extra core/cog for the PASM I2C engine (none if the SPIN I2C engine is used)
* sensor.temp_rh.common.spinh (source: spin-standard-library)

P2/SPIN2:
* p2-spin-standard-library
* sensor.temp_rh.common.spin2h (source: p2-spin-standard-library)

## Compiler Compatibility

* P1/SPIN1 OpenSpin (bytecode): Untested (deprecated)
* P1/SPIN1 FlexSpin (bytecode): OK, tested with 5.9.7-beta
* P1/SPIN1 FlexSpin (native): OK, tested with 5.9.7-beta
* ~~P2/SPIN2 FlexSpin (nu-code): FTBFS, tested with 5.9.7-beta~~
* P2/SPIN2 FlexSpin (native): OK, tested with 5.9.7-beta
* ~~BST~~ (incompatible - no preprocessor)
* ~~Propeller Tool~~ (incompatible - no preprocessor)
* ~~PNut~~ (incompatible - no preprocessor)

## Limitations

* TBD
